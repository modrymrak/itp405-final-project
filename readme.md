#About

The site will be about posting links to articles and commenting on them, somewhat like Reddit's posts.

#Users

Anyone is welcome to use the website, the main target audience being myself and some of my friends.

#Accounts

Using Laravel's built-in authentication system, users will be required to create an account before using the service.

#API

The tables in use are:
*users
*password_resets
*articles
*comments
*countries
